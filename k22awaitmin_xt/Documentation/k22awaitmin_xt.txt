Module "pin_mux"   (component PinSettings)
   - pin_mux_hardware_init -This method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method in user code to route 
                desired pins into peripherals. The method is useful for reinitialization HW after some routing changes.
   - pin_mux_configure_ftm_pins -FTM method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into FTM0, FTM1, FTM2, FTM3 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_gpio_pins -GPIO method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into PTA, PTB, PTC, PTD, PTE peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_i2c_pins -I2C method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into I2C0, I2C1 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_i2s_pins -I2S method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into I2S0 peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_jtag_pins -JTAG method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into JTAG peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_llwu_pins -LLWU method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into LLWU peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_osc_pins -OSC method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into OSC peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_rtc_pins -RTC method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into RTC peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_spi_pins -SPI method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into SPI0, SPI1 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_uart_pins -UART method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into UART0, UART1, UART2 peripherals.

Module "Bit1"      (component BitIO)
   - Bit1_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Bit1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
