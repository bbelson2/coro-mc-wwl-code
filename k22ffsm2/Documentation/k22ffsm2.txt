Module "MCUC1"     (component McuLibConfig)
   - MCUC1_Init -Driver initialization method
   - MCUC1_Deinit -Driver deinitialization method

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "FC1"       (component FreeCntr)
   - FC1_Reset -This method resets the timer-counter (sets to zero for up-counting HW or to appropriate value for down-counting 
                HW). The method is available only if the counter register can be set by software and the counter is not shared.
   - FC1_GetCounterValue -This method returns a content of the counter.

Module "TU2"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU2_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU2_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts vectors, 
                etc.
   - TU2_GetEventStatus -Returns current pending flags and clears them.   Note: If corresponding events are generated then 
                these interrupt flags are deleted directly in the ISR. See Properties "Interrupt" and related events.
   - TU2_ResetCounter -Resets counter. If counter is counting up then it is set to zero. If counter is counting down then 
                counter is updated to the reload value.   The method is not available if HW doesn't allow resetting of the 
                counter.
   - TU2_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.

Module "I2C"       (component InternalI2C)
   - I2C_SendChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address 
                bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes one character (byte) to the bus. The slave 
                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or in the component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is obtainable from 
                (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost) events.   When working as a SLAVE, this method writes a character to 
                the internal output slave buffer and, after the master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no 
                character is ready for a transmission (internal output slave buffer is empty), the Empty character will be sent 
                (see "Empty character" property).
   - I2C_RecvChar -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address 
                bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads one character (byte) from the bus and then sends the 
                stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" method or 
                in component initialization section, property "Target slave address init". If interrupt service is enabled and 
                the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state of 
                transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of successful 
                transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, this 
                method reads a character from the input slave buffer.
   - I2C_SendBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 0 to the I2C bus and then writes the block of characters to the bus. The 
                slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SlaveSelect10" method or in component 
                initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is enabled and the method 
                returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The state of transmission is detectable by 
                means of events (OnTransmitData, OnError or OnArbitLost). Data to be send is not copied to an internal buffer 
                and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer should not be changed until the 
                transmission is complete. Event OnTransmitData can be used to detect the end of the transmission.  When working 
                as a SLAVE, this method writes a block of characters to the internal output slave buffer and then, after the 
                master starts the communication, to the I2C bus. If no character is ready for a transmission (internal output 
                slave buffer is empty), the "Empty character" will be sent (see "Empty character" property). In SLAVE mode the 
                data are copied to an internal buffer, if specified by "Output buffer size" property.
   - I2C_RecvBlock -When working as a MASTER, this method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave 
                address bytes inclusive of R/W bit = 1 to the I2C bus, then reads the block of characters from the bus and then 
                sends the stop condition. The slave address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlave" or "SelectSlave10" 
                method or in component initialization section, "Target slave address init" property. If interrupt service is 
                enabled and the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was finished successfully. The state 
                of transmission must be tested by means of events (OnReceiveData, OnError or OnArbitLost). In case of 
                successful transmission, received data is ready after OnReceiveData event is called.   When working as a SLAVE, 
                this method reads a block of characters from the input slave buffer.
   - I2C_SendStop -If the "Automatic stop condition" property value is 'no', this method sends a valid stop condition to the 
                serial data line of the I2C bus to terminate the communication on the bus after using send methods. This method 
                is enabled only if "Automatic stop condition" property is set to 'no'.
   - I2C_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns number of characters in the output buffer. In SLAVE mode returns the number of characters in 
                the internal slave output buffer. In MASTER mode returns number of characters to be sent from the user buffer 
                (passed by SendBlock method).  This method is not supported in polling mode.
   - I2C_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns number of characters in the input buffer. In SLAVE mode returns the number of characters in 
                the internal slave input buffer. In MASTER mode returns number of characters to be received into a user buffer 
                (passed by RecvChar or RecvBlock method).   This method is not supported in polling mode.
   - I2C_SelectSlave -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave address value. Any send or receive 
                method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected by this method. This method is 
                not available for the SLAVE mode.

Module "Bit1"      (component BitIO)
   - Bit1_SetDir -Sets a pin direction (available only if the direction = _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].
   - Bit1_PutVal -The specified output value is set. If the direction is [input], the component saves the value to a memory or 
                a register and this value will be written to the pin after switching to the output mode (using [SetDir(TRUE)]; 
                see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output], it writes the value to the pin. 
                (Method is available only if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
   - Bit1_ClrVal -Clears (set to zero) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(FALSE)]. This method is available only 
                if the direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.
   - Bit1_SetVal -Sets (to one) the output value. It is equivalent to the [PutVal(TRUE)]. This method is available only if the 
                direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN512LH12)
   - Cpu_SetClockConfiguration -Calling of this method will cause the clock configuration change and reconfiguration of all 
                components according to the requested clock configuration setting.
   - Cpu_GetClockConfiguration -Returns the active clock configuration identifier. The method is automatically enabled if more 
                than one clock configuration is enabled in the component.
